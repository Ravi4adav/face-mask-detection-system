# Face Mask Detection System

    It is a Computer Vision Application which can detect whether a person wear a mask or not and then store their data who are not wearing the mask.

    This application can get data from various sources such as IP Camera, webcam and online video etc.

    The IP camera is a wireless surveillance camera which can send footage to the wi-fi network to which it is connected, if the computer which contains the application is also connected with the same wi-fi network then we will be able to work on that footage data into our project and can detect mask.

# Setup Procedure

        virtualenv <virtualenv_path or env_name>
